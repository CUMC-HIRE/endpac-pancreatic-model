# R Scripts for Figures

`ceac` : cost effectiveness acceptability curve (% simulations preferred at different WTPs) <br>
`efficiency_frontier` : base-case results, plots cost and eff on plane <br> 
`owsa_plots` : one-way sensitivity analysis, specifically for risk-strat and screening characteristics <br>
`psa` : psa scatterplot for all simulations <br>
`twowsa_threshold_price` : two way sensitivity analysis comparing cost of SCED and specificity of SCED, identifying threshold price for cost-effectiveness under 100k WTP
